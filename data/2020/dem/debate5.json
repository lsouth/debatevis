So on paid family leave, it is no longer the case in America that people are having children in their 20s. People are having children in their 30s, often in their 40s, which means that these families and parents are often raising young children and taking care of their parents, which requires a lot of work, from traveling back and forth to a hospital to daycare to all of the activities that are required, much less the health care needs that are required. And what we are seeing in America today is the burden principally falls on women to do that work. And many women are having to make a very difficult choice whether they're going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family, or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on. So six months paid family leave is meant to and is designed to adjust to the reality of women's lives today. The reality also is that women are not paid equal for equal work in America. We passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, but fast forward to the year of our lord 2019, and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar, black women 61 cents, Native American women 58 cents, Latinas 53 cents.", "index": 105, "speaker": "harris", "type": "", "target": "", "audience_actions": [], "is_interruption": false, "topics": {"healthcare": ["health care"]}, "mentions": [], "polarity": 0.325, "subjectivity": 0.3534722222222222, "first_mention": [], "last_mention": [], "sentences": ["HARRIS: Sure.", "And, everybody, please visit my website, kamalaharris.org, for the details on everything I talk about.", "Six months, so part of how I believe we're going to win this election is, it is going to be because we are focused on the future, we are focused on the challenges that are presented today and not trying to bring back yesterday to solve tomorrow."]}, {"text": " Thank you.", "index": 106, "speaker": "parker", "type": "", "target": "", "audience_actions": [], "is_interruption": false, "topics": {}, "mentions": [], "polarity": 0.0, "subjectivity": 0.0, "first_mention": [], "last_mention": [], "sentences": ["PARKER: Thank you."]}, {"text": " So my policy is about -- there's a whole collection of the work that I am doing that is focused on women and working women in America and the inequities and, therefore, the injustice that women in America are facing that needs to be resolved and addressed.", "index": 107, "speaker": "harris", "type": "", "target": "", "audience_actions": [], "is_interruption": false, "topics": {}, "mentions": [], "polarity": 0.2, "subjectivity": 0.4, "first_mention": [], "last_mention": [], "sentences": ["HARRIS: So my policy is about -- there's a whole collection of the work that I am doing that is focused on women and working women in America and the inequities and, therefore, the injustice that women in America are facing that needs to be resolved and addressed."]}, {"text": " Thank you, Senator.
