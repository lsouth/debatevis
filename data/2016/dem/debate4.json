Sixty seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups or rebuttals. I know you'll all keep exactly to time, so our job should be pretty easy here tonight. We'll have questions from the Youtube community throughout the debate. This is a critical point in the race. You've been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail.

[applause] Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition. And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case. We need to learn the lessons from the past. We do need to provide the special \u2014 special ops advisers, we need \u2014 do need to provide the technical support, but over the long-term, we need to develop new alliances. We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines. And I also want to add one other thing here. I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we don't use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato and macho sending other kids \u2014 kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground. A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, \"Governor, when you're with your colleagues, please don't refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground.\" Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past.

Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.

Qatar happens to be the largest \u2014 wealthiest country per capita in the world. They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it.
