The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump. [applause] Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome. Let\u2019s get right to it. The first topic is the Supreme Court. You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments. Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century. First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country? And secondly, what\u2019s your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted? Do the founders\u2019 words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances? In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first.

And thanks to UNLV for hosting us. You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have? And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women\u2019s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system. That\u2019s how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans. And I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. That\u2019s the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.

Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent. And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made. We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don\u2019t think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.

Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, \u201cThe Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.\u201d And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited.

Because I support the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t mean that I want people who shouldn\u2019t have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family. And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. There\u2019s other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment. You mentioned the Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.

Why aren\u2019t the NATO questioned\u2014why aren\u2019t they paying? Because they weren\u2019t paying. Since I did this\u2014this was a year ago\u2014all of a sudden, they\u2019re paying. And I\u2019ve been given a lot\u2014a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they\u2019re starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We\u2019re protecting people, they have to pay up. And I\u2019m a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up. She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it\u2019s awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are. We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama\u2019s regime, we\u2019ve doubled our national debt. We\u2019re up to $20 trillion. So my plan\u2014we\u2019re going to renegotiate trade deals. We\u2019re going to have a lot of free trade. We\u2019re going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy. You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We\u2019re bringing our jobs back. I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can\u2019t make a great deal\u2014then we\u2019re going to terminate NAFTA and we\u2019re going to create new deals. We\u2019re going to have trade, but we\u2019re going\u2014we\u2019re going to terminate it, we\u2019re going to make a great trade deal. And if we can\u2019t, we\u2019re going to do it\u2014we\u2019re going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively.

And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He\u2014he aligned with Russia. He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back.

They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life. And you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t want to rip families apart. I don\u2019t want to be sending parents away from children. I don\u2019t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country. We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, here\u2019s what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country. I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it\u2019s an idea that would rip our country apart. When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn\u2019t even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we\u2019re not paying for that wall.

But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants. Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can\u2019t exploit them and undercut Americans\u2019 wages.

This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past.

New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses. I want us to do more to help small business.

I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not\u2014who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do. I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.

I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted. And we\u2019re going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.

Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren\u2019t they paying? She immediately\u2014when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren\u2019t the NATO questioned\u2014why aren\u2019t they paying? Because they weren\u2019t paying. Since I did this\u2014this was a year ago\u2014all of a sudden, they\u2019re paying.

It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country. I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it\u2019s an idea that would rip our country apart. When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn\u2019t even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we\u2019re not paying for that wall. So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with a path to citizenship.", "sentence": " When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.", "statement_index": 34, "classification": "neutral"}, {"source": "clinton", "target": "trump", "statement_polarity": 0.31298701298701304, "sentence_polarity": 0.0, "statement": " There are some limited places where that was appropriate.

Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can\u2019t exploit them and undercut Americans\u2019 wages.

By contrast, Donald\u2019s plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.

You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.

I\u2019ve got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters. I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real\u2014a really successful military operation. But we know we\u2019ve got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue. So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS. That\u2019s why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don\u2019t let terrorists buy weapons. If you\u2019re too dangerous to fly, you\u2019re too dangerous to buy a gun. And I\u2019m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.", "sentence": [], "statement_index": 251}, {"statement": " Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.

So now we\u2019ve dug ourselves out of it, we\u2019re standing, but we\u2019re not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.

You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, \u201cYou know, I alone can fix it,\u201d as he said on the convention stage.

We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We\u2019ll have what economists call middle-out growth. We\u2019ve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. That\u2019s where growth will come from.
