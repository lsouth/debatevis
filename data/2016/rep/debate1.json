The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don\u2019t pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee.

How is she \u2014 how is she gonna lecture me \u2014 how is she gonna lecture me about student loans? I owed over $100,000 just four years ago.
